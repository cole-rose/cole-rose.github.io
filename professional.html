                                            progress. I am creating a MERN based

                                            Node.js) social media application
                                            that will allow users to create
                                            plans and share them with their
                                            friends. The goal is to have an
                                            itinerary that can be easily sent to
                                            people when you have an idea for a
                                            meetup, date, vacation, etc. The
                                            project uses TypeScript as the
                                            primary language. I am creating the

                                            This project aimed to predict
                                            contraceptive use in women based on
                                            various demographic and
                                            socioeconomic characteristics.
                                            Additionally, the efficacy of
                                            logistic regression, decision trees,
                                            and random forest models on
                                            predicting contraceptive use was
                                            evaluated. The problem was initially
                                            framed as a three class problem. The
                                            initial three classes of
                                            contraceptive use were No Use, Short
                                            Term Use, and Long Term Use. The
                                            problem was later reduced to a two
                                            class case by combining No Use and
                                            Short Term Use into a single class.
                                            Various techniques such as feature
                                            engineering, hyperparameter tuning,
                                            oversampling, undersampling, and
                                            SMOTE sampling were performed in an
                                            attempt to optimize the models. The
                                            most successful model was a fine

                                            class case. The model used 110
                                            learners with a max depth of 6. The
                                            final model had a resulting training
                                            and test accuracy of 77.50 % and
                                            73.76 % respectively.

                                        <p>At CalHacks 2018, I lead a team of 3
                                            in developing a supervised deep
                                            learning algorithm for classifiying
                                            images of cellular tissue
                                            as cancerous or benign. I initially
                                            utilized convolutional neural
                                            networks in Tensorflow Keras to
                                            train over 4000 images.
                                            Not getting the results that I
                                            wanted, I deduced that one or more
                                            of the following problems had
                                            occured: the number of epochs that I
                                            used was too low (the training did
                                            not converge), I did not have enough
                                            data to capture the variance among
                                            the images, or that my network
                                            needed more layers. My laptop did
                                            not have the necessary computing
                                            power for me to increase the epochs
                                            and layers in the limited
                                            time that I had. After researching
                                            for some time, I discovered a
                                            solution to solve both of my
                                            problems. First, I uploaded the cell
                                            images to Google Cloud. I then
                                            utilized Google's pretrained
                                            networks through Google's AutoML API
                                            to
                                            increase the accuracy and speed of
                                            my training. This resulted in an
                                            algorithm with over 98% accuracy, as
                                            can be seen in the confusion matrix
                                            displayed in the picture to the
                                            right.

                                        <p>For this project, I gathered 1000
                                            Reuters articles across 5 different
                                            topics. My goal was to see if I
                                            could correctly seperate the
                                            articles into their respective
                                            topics based on the unique words in
                                            their articles. I parsed through all
                                            of the articles and gathered a set
                                            of all of the unique words in the
                                            articles. I then made a matrix with
                                            the rows as article names and the
                                            columns as unique words. The entries
                                            of the matrix contained a 1 if the
                                            word was present in the
                                            corresponding article and a 0
                                            otherwise. I then calculated the
                                            covariance of all the article pairs
                                            and placed that into a matrix after
                                            normalizing the entries. I then ran
                                            principal component analysis on the
                                            covariance matrix to project the
                                            data to its first two principal
                                            components. Before clustering the
                                            data, I used the elbow method to
                                            determine the optimal number of
                                            clusters for the data. Although I
                                            already knew the data should have
                                            corresponded to five clusters, I
                                            wanted to make sure that the data
                                            reflected that based on my analysis.
                                            The elbow curve properly predicted
                                            that 5 clusters would be optimal. I
                                            then clustered the PCA data using k
                                            means clustering through pythons
                                            sklearn package, which properly
                                            seperated the data into 5 clusters.

                                        <p>Here is a video of my group’s
                                            completed project for our EE16B:
                                            Designing Information Devices and
                                            Systems II course! We spent
                                            countless hours implementing the
                                            micboard, bandpass filter, biasing
                                            circuits, wheel encoders, wheel
                                            motors, and much more in addition to
                                            writing a lot of code along the way
                                            to allow our car to be controllable.
                                            Our car was powered by two 9V
                                            batteries and an MSP-EXP430F
                                            launchpad. My favorite part of the
                                            project was implementing the voice
                                            control. To do this, we gathered
                                            about 30 voice recorded samples each
                                            for 4 words that were very
                                            colloquially dissimilar to maximize
                                            the variance among the data. The
                                            data was then placed into a matrix
                                            with the data for each word
                                            belonging to its own row. We used a
                                            supervised machine learning
                                            algorithm based on classification to
                                            carry out the voice control. We
                                            performed principal component
                                            analysis on the training data to
                                            project the data onto the first two
                                            principal components, as they
                                            captured most of the variance in the
                                            data. We then used K-means
                                            clustering with 4 centroids to group
                                            the words with the highest
                                            covariance. Our algorithm predicted
                                            which word each input belonged to by
                                            determining which cluster had the
                                            minimum euclidean distance to the
                                            input data.</p>
