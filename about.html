                            <p>I grew up in the small town of Simi Valley, California, about 45 minutes away from Los Angeles. My path from childhood to now was far from a straight trajectory. I grew up with an alcoholic mother and had a fairly rough childhood.
                                My focus on education was minimal at best. Shortly after my eighteenth birthday, the home that I grew up in was foreclosed on. Since then I have lived on my own.</p>

                            <p>After moving out I realized that my current minimum wage job at The Habit Burger Grill wouldn't be enough to afford living on my own. I became a delivery driver at Toppers Pizza. The added money from the tips I received allowed
                                me to support myself. Shortly after working at Toppers, I decided it was time to get serious about my education. I enrolled in Moorpark Community College, a decision that would change my life completely. </p>

                            <p>After starting Moorpark College, I realized how behind I was in comparison with my peers. I knew that I wanted to go into something STEM related, but I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to major in. After exploring multiple majors
                                and speaking to counselors, I discovered just how much work it would take for me to major in a STEM related field. I had barely scraped by in high school, and my highest mathematics class was Geometry. In order to transfer
                                to a four year university, I would not only have to take the lower division college courses needed for my major, but I would also have to catch up on all of the math and science courses that I didn't take in high school.

                        <div class="about-content">
                            <p>I didn't let the extra requirements to transfer steer me away from STEM. I dove headfirst into my coursework while working part time to pay the bills. I eventually decided to major in Bioengineering. The interdisciplinary nature
                                of the major appealed to me. It was the perfect intersection of the life sciences, hard sciences, and engineering. Since I was excelling in my coursework, many of my peers asked me for help on their assignments. I loved
                                being able to help my peers succeed, so I switched from working as a pizza delivery driver to working as a tutor in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Throughout the rest of my time at Moorpark, I worked both as a private
                                tutor and as a tutoring consultant for Professional Tutors of America.</p>

                            <p>Although I spent more time at Moorpark College than the average Joe, I sure learned a lot. In addition to completing my General Education requirements, I took almost every STEM class at Moorpark College. All in all, I took
                                7 Math courses, 3 Physics courses, 2 Biology courses, 5 Chemistry courses, and a Computer Science course. I left Moorpark with a perfect 4.0 GPA and 5 associates degrees. I did this all while working and maintaining my
                                involvement in on campus clubs. I was President of the Beta Sigma Rho Chapter of Phi Theta Kappa Honors Society from 2014 to 2015 and was Vice President of the Chemistry Club from 2016 to 2017. In addition, I received 5
                                scholarships while at Moorpark College. While growing up in my mother&#39;s home, I never believed that success was in the cards for me. After being on my own, I proved to myself just how resilient I could be. I was accepted
                                to UC Berkeley as a Bioengineering major in the Fall of 2017, where I would discover my passion for computer science.
