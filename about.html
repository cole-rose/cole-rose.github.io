						<p>I grew up in the small town of Simi Valley, California, about 45 minutes away from Los Angeles. My path from childhood to now was far from a straight trajectory. I grew up with an alcoholic mother and had a fairly rough childhood. My focus on education was minimal at best. Shortly after my eigteenth birthday, the home I grew up in was forclosed on, since then I have lived on my own.</p>

						<p>After moving out I realized that my current minimum wage job wouldn't be enough to afford living on my own. I became a delivery driver at Toppers Pizza. The added money from the tips I received allowed me to support myself. Shortly after working at Toppers, I decided it was time to get serious about my education. I enrolled in Moorpark Community College, a decision that would change my life completely. </p>

						<p>After starting Moorpark College, I realized how behind I was in comparison with my peers. I knew that I wanted to go into something STEM related, but I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to major in. After exploring multiple majors and speaking to counselors, I discovered just how much work it would take for me to major in a STEM related field. I had barely scraped by in high school, and my highest mathematics class was Geometry. In order to transfer to a 4 year university, I would not only have to take the lower division college courses needed for my major, but I would also have to catch up on all of the math and science courses that I didn't take in high school. </p>
