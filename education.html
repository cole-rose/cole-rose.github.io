							<p>Worked in the HART lab of Dr. Ruzena Bajcsy. Our group worked on a semi-autonomous driving system aimed at reducing distraction and discomfort in the environment by minimizing psychoacoutic annoyance. Throughout my time in the HART lab, I was trained in the basics of supervised and unsupervised machine learning. I drove a car equipped with a lidar, microphones, cameras, and pressure sensors to collect real data on multiple occasions. I utilized Robot Operating System to perform object detection on the data collected from our experiments. In addition, I developed an efficient data manipulation program to join the data across multiple experiments by time. The program streamlined the training of the data by consolidating all of the data into one place. </p>
