							<p>This summer I will begin a full time research program at the Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama. 
					 			The program, titled "NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) on Smart UAV's" is fully funded by the NSF and the Department of Defense. The goal of the research will be to develop advanced algorithms to autonomously fly unmanned air vehicles in a limited air field to fulfill different kinds of missions.

							<p>Currently working in the HART lab of Dr. Ruzena Bajcsy. The group that I'm in is currently working on a semi-autonomous driving system aimed at reducing distraction and discomfort in the environment by minimizing psychoacoutic acnnoyance. Throughout my time in the HART lab, I've been trained in the basics of supervised and unsupervised machine learning. I've driven a car equiped with a lidar, microphones, cameras, and pressure sensors to collect real data on multiple occasions. I have utilized Robot Operating System to perform object detection on the data collected from our expirements. In addition, I developed an efficient data manipulation program to join the data across multiple experiments by time. The program streamlined the training of the data by consolidating all of the data in to one place. </p>
